Mempool is the fully-featured mempool visualizer, explorer, and API service running at [mempool.space](https://mempool.space/). 

It is an open-source project developed and operated for the benefit of the Bitcoin community, with a focus on the emerging transaction fee market that is evolving Litecoin into a multi-layer ecosystem.

# Installation Methods

Mempool can be self-hosted on a wide variety of your own hardware, ranging from a simple one-click installation on a Raspberry Pi full-node distro all the way to a robust production instance on a powerful FreeBSD server. 

## Advanced Installation Methods

Mempool can be installed in other ways too, but we only recommend doing so if you're a developer, have experience managing servers, or otherwise know what you're doing.

- See the [`docker/`](./docker/) directory for instructions on deploying Mempool with Docker.
- See the [`backend/`](./backend/) and [`frontend/`](./frontend/) directories for manual install instructions oriented for developers.
- See the [`production/`](./production/) directory for guidance on setting up a more serious Mempool instance designed for high performance at scale.
